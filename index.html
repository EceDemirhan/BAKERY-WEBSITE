            Cheesecake is a dessert consisting of one or more layers. The main and thickest layer consists of a mixture of soft, fresh cheese (typically cream cheese or ricotta), eggs, and sugar. If there is a base layer, it usually consists of a crust or base made of crushed cookies (or digestive biscuits), graham crackers, pastries, sponge cake, or sometimes sponge cake. It can be cooked or uncooked (usually refrigerated).

Cheesecake is often sweetened with sugar and can be flavored in many different ways. It can be flavored by adding vanilla, spices, lemon, chocolate, pumpkin or other flavors to the cheese layer. Additional flavors and visual appeal can be added to the finished pie by filling it with fruit, whipped cream, nuts, cookies, fruit sauce, chocolate syrup or other ingredients.

Ironically, modern cheesecake, whose name means "cheesecake", is not generally classified as a cake, despite its name. People who classify it as a torte point to the presence of many eggs, which alone are the source of release, as a key factor. For others, the overall structure, separate crust, soft filling, and lack of flour are compelling evidence that this is a cream pie. Other sources describe it as a flan or flan.
